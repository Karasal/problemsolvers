# Problem Solvers — Progress

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅
- [x] Next.js 14+ scaffolded (TypeScript + Tailwind + App Router)

- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Tailwind configured with neon color palette + two-state CSS system
- [x] Scroll engine (Lenis + GSAP ScrollTrigger) wired up
- [x] Toggle state context (dormant/alive) with data-attribute CSS switching

- [x] All 6 section shell components with scroll-triggered GSAP animations
- [x] SplineToggle placeholder (ready for .splinecode swap)
- [x] Lead capture form (ready for Supabase connection)
- [x] Sound toggle UI
- [x] GSAP animation presets library
- [x] Constants file (copy, colors, config)
- [x] Git init + push to GitHub

## Phase 2: The Gate ✅
- [x] HeroToggle — SVG face morph (sad→happy) with Framer Motion
- [x] Particle burst + energy cracks on activation
- [x] Char-by-char GSAP text reveal (dormant → alive)
- [x] Neon background gradient transition + holographic noise overlay
- [x] Floating neon shape decoration

## Phase 3: Sections ✅
- [x] Asset pipeline — 118MB → 5.6MB (sharp/WebP, 95% compression)
- [x] 227 Y2K SVGs + 57 WebP images + 5 audio files curated
- [x] Section 1 — THE WOW (3-layer parallax, rorschach bg, neon shapes, Y2K SVGs, stagger title)
- [x] Section 2 — THE PITCH (word-by-word tagline, AI chip, 24-bot army grid, CSS marquee ticker)

- [x] Audio — Real SFX wired (bell, bass, whoosh, button-push, delay ambient loop)
- [x] Build passes clean, pushed to GitHub

## Phase 4: Polish

- [ ] Brand identity (logo, favicon, OG images)
- [ ] SEO + meta tags
- [ ] Connect Vercel

## Phase 5: Ship
